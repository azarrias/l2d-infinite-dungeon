# Infinite Dungeon

Infinite Dungeon is a 2D procedurally generated dungeon game.
As the title implies, the dungeon is infinite, so every time that the player passes a doorway it will enter a newly created room. 
This new room will always be created from scratch at the moment of the transition, even if the player is going back to a previously visited room.
